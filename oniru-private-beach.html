                    The Oniru beach is a privately owned beach located at Eti-Osa Local government Area. The oniru beach is good for both swimming and picnics, however, it is exceptionally packed and uproarious on occasion. Horseback riding is accessible for an expense. The Oniru Beach is a 24 hours exclusive beach in Lagos Nigeria. The beach is owned by the Oniru Royal family. The Oniru Beach has a grill joint, suya (kind of meat) and fish spot, and a bar for assortments of drink.
