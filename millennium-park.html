            The Millennium Park, which is situated in the Maitama neighborhood of the city, is Abuja's largest public park.
          </p>
          <p>
            On December 4, 2003, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom officially opened the Millennium Park. It is situated adjacent to the former Presidential Palace and the center of the city's executive and administrative structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Park is divided into two halves by a river that runs along to its principal rectilinear axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Park's one half is devoted to pristine nature. Nigeria's highland vegetation, savannah, deciduous forest, rain forest, brushwood, and greenhouses for butterflies and tropical birds are all found on a system of terraces at various levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other side is devoted to the scientific study of the natural environment and corresponds to the major entrance from the road. This area of the Park has a highly classic and rigorous Italian Style Garden Plan. The visitor is welcomed into the Park's green spaces by a rectilinear route that is totally covered in Roman white travertine. Beside this white mark are a number of fountains that keep people cool on hot days. This route creates a visual connection between the Aso Rock, Abuja's holiest rock, and the gigantic Cotton Tree, a sacred tree located on one side of Millennium Park. The road is laid out using a trident geometry, which is divided by sizable polygonal lakes.
            The roads are crossed by a series of multicoloured bushes going from yellow to red with a very particular wave-like course.
