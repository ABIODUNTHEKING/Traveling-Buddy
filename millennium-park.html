            Located in the middle of Lagos, this conservation center is home to
            abundant plants and wildlife and plays a vital role in preserving
            the region’s ecosystem. Sign up for a guided tour with
            transportation included, or you can just as easily hail a rideshare
            and make your own way there.
          </p>

            Take a stroll through the swamp boardwalk and spot rare birds,
            monkeys, snakes, and crocodiles. The park is also home to the
            longest canopy walkway in Africa, offering 360-degree views from
            above the treetops. If you’re afraid of heights, fret not—crossing
            this suspended walkway is optional.

            The reserve covers an area of 78 hectares and is located on the
            Lekki Peninsula, adjacent to the Lekki Lagoon. It protects the
            wetlands of the Lekki Peninsula, which consists of swamp and
            savannah habitats. Close to the reserve, there is a coconut grove
            lined avenue leading to an elaborate row of car and visitor parks.
            It has a rich flora and fauna life. Its vast wetlands are reserved
            for wildlife viewing. Elevated walkways make it possible to see
            animals such as monkeys, crocodiles, snakes, various birds and more.
            The wetlands are managed by the Nigerian Foundation for Conservation
            of Nature. A trail boardwalk was built in 1992 to allow visitors to
            enjoy the scenery within the nature reserve. Other attractions along
            the way include wetlands, bird skins, rest stops, and tree houses
          </p>

            When in Lagos, take a trip to the Lekki Conservation Center and
            check out all the animals, like peacocks, snakes, crocodiles, plus
            hundreds of species of plants. You’ll have your own private,
            English-speaking guide who will tell you all about the conservation
            center. Ask questions about the plants and animals, and explore at
            your own pace.
