                    In Lagos, Nigeria, the Lagos Motorboat Club is a well-known and respectable private boat club. Some former Lagos Tarpon Club members founded it in 1950. The club didn't have an arena for many years after it was founded, so it held events at Wilmott Point instead. When the club moved to its own private venue on Awolowo Drive in Ikoyi Lagos, things took a wonderful turn.

                    It now proudly boasts several modifications and renovations, including 200 conventional motorboats, a restaurant, and world-class amenities including a mermaid water bar and a spherical bar called Gillmore's Folly. The Clubhouse's architectural style and the Indian almond trees that sway inside its grounds both contribute to the tranquility of the area, which is quite striking.

                    The club is active on Sundays as members board motorboats to access their own beach houses next to creeks outside the clubhouse. After twilight, it's enjoyable to see boats mounting and dismounting from the creeks.
